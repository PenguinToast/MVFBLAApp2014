Instructions to using the app:

When the app is first opened, a screen, like the first screen will appear. To continue
from the screen, you must log in using the blue "Log in to Facebook" button.
After you are logged in, you can choose any of the buttons to enter the app. Each of 
the buttons will take you to a different screen of the app, each for its own specified 
purpose.

Inside of each of these screens, there is a navigation bar that can be accessed if you 
press on the MVFBLA image at the top left of the screen. This is shown in the second 
picture of the pdf. Through this navigation bar, you will be able to access any of the on the app.

The first screen on the list is the Forums screen. This screen is shown in the third picture of the pdf. In this screen, you are able to press on any of the posts, and they will automatically expand. Only one post can be opened at a time. At the bottom of the screen, there is a text box that you can type in. This is used for posting. 

To create a new post, you have to unselect whatever post you currently have selected. To do this, simply tap on the post that is orange, and you will unselect the post. After you are unselected, you can just type your new post inside the editable box at the bottom of the screen, and press "Submit". Your post will become the very first post.

To reply to a post, you have to select an already existing post, and type a reply inside of the text box at the bottom of the screen. The text box for replying is the same as the text box for posting. After you have typed your new reply, simply press the "Submit" button and the reply will occur. Also, the post you reply to will become the topmost post.

The second screen is the profile page. On it displays your name, the number of points you have, the number of posts you have, and your experience. At the bottom of your screen, there is also a check-in location services. This is shown in the fourth page in the pdf of screenshots.

The points is based off of merit system, in which you receive points for receiving likes from other people, posting your first post, and answering questions correctly in the testing screen (which I will talk about later). Your experience is based off of the number of points you have, and so it is still based on a merit system.

The Check in Location button at the bottom of the screen, when pressed, will display your Current location directly under it, as shown inside the picture in the pdf file.

The third screen is the leader board. This displays a list of all the people who have logged onto this app. Their number of points are shown at the left of their name, and they are ranked based on the number of points they have. The higher the points, the higher place they are, so you had better start gaining points now! This is shown in the fifth picture of the screenshot pdf file.

The fourth and final screen is the testing screen. This screen is used to allow the user to test his own abilities, and to find new questions to ask in the Forums screen. There are many questions for the user to answer, and there WILL be repeats. If you answer a question correctly, you receive a point. If you answer it incorrectly, you will not receive any points. A message will display at the bottom of the screen, telling you if you got it right or wrong.

Enjoy!
